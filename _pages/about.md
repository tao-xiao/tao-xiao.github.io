Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Tao Xiao, and I am a doctoral student at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. I belong to the [Software Engineering Lab](https://naist-se.github.io/).

My research goal is to leverage empirical evidence and knowledge from software repositories to make software development more productive, effective, and efficient. Specifically, my research mainly focus on software quality (i.e., technical debt) and knowledge sharing (i.e., the usage of links in software developement).

Education Background
======
* Doctoral student at Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.
* Master of Engineering from Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan, in 2022.
* BSc degree in Software Engineering from Chiang Mai University, Thailand, in  2020.
